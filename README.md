- **Outlier Detection**: Used **boxplots** and **z-score** techniques.

## 3️⃣ Feature Engineering
- **Created new features** (e.g., Temperature Anomaly, CO2 per capita).
- **Removed redundant features** to improve model performance.

## 4️⃣ Machine Learning Models
### 📌 Models Implemented:
✅ **Linear Regression** – For understanding linear climate trends.
✅ **Random Forest Regressor** – Captures complex relationships in the data.
✅ **XGBoost Regressor** – Optimized for higher accuracy and robustness.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Used **GridSearchCV** for model optimization.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identified key factors affecting climate change.

## 5️⃣ Model Evaluation
- **R² Score** (Goodness of fit)
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** (Deviation of predictions from actual values)
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** (Measures prediction accuracy)
- **Visualized Model Performance** using prediction vs. actual plots.

## 6️⃣ Climate Change Prediction
- Forecasted **temperature, sea level, and CO2 levels** for the next decade.
- **Scenario Analysis**: Simulated different CO2 emission levels.
